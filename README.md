# Apps - API Server at [api.thegreenwebfoundation.org](http://api.thegreenwebfoundation.org/)


In `/apps/api` is the code served to you when you visit http://api.thegreenwebfoundation.org.

When requests come in, symfony accepts and validates the request, and creates a job for enqeueue to service with a worker.

See the [project readme](apps/api/Readme.md) for further installation and deployment instructions.

# Packages - Greencheck

In `packages/greencheck` is the library used for carrying out checks against the Green Web Foundation Database. Workers take jobs in a RabbitMQ queue, and call the greencheck code to return the result quickly, before passing the result, RPC-style to the original calling code in symfony API server.
